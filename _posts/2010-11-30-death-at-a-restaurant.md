Have this ever happen to you? You went to a restaurant, alone. You sat down, waiting for a somebody to attend to you and take your order. You sat and waited for about 10 minutes or so, but none of the waiters and waitresses notice your existent. So the first thing on your mind was that you are dead and you are now a ghost.

It’s almost 15 minutes now, and still no waiter, no menu, no order. I put up my hands and did everything civilly appropriate to get their attention, but it’s as if they couldn’t see me. That would mean two things, either I have suddenly activated my mutant ability to become invisible, or that I have already died and it’s my ghost, the [astral projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_projection) of my spirit roaming around.

I quickly deducted that I am no invisible, and that I don’t have mutant powers, at least I think I don’t. Besides if I were invisible, people around me would freak out looking at the clothes I’m wearing moving on it’s own. Everybody knows that you can only turn your body invisible and not your clothes. You’ll have to be completely naked to be totally invisible and unnoticeable. I wonder how it would feel to walk naked in a shopping complex.

Anyway I still have my clothes on, therefore the other reason of why none of the waiters notices me is that I am dead. I retraced back my steps to try to figure out how did I die. What did I do earlier today? and when did I die? Was it a car accident? Did I get stab? I don’t think so.

I start to recall when was my last human interaction. I walked around with my earphones all day so that everybody would leave me alone. You don’t need mutant powers to be invisible, earphones has the same effects.

I tried hard to recall when did I died, but it was of no use. Most probably I was dead for long time and that I just realize that today. Did my family missed me? Does anybody misses me? Does anybody cares?

I wanted to call the people I know and ask them, but decided not too. It would freak them out to hear a dead person’s voice. Well, if a dead person were to called me and talked to me, it would freak me out too.

I start to think about all my stuff. Who is going to feed Mandy my cat? What about my blog? what would happen to it? I guess once I stop renewing the domain name it would just fade away from the internet and fade away from people’s mind, just like myself.

I guess I’ve to accept the fact that I am dead. What am I supposed to do now? Shouldn’t there be a light that I should go through or something? I need to talk to someone, and I hope that someone is as attractive as [Jennifer Love Hewitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Whisperer).

I looked around the restaurant, all these people smiling, laughing, enjoying their meal with each other. Could dead people taste food? I don’t think so. Being dead sucks. Being dead is sad. It is depressing up to a point where you would kill yourself, but you can’t because you only die once, which makes the whole thing much more depressing.

I’m about to breakdown and cry over how things suck right now. I tried to hold it in, wouldn’t want to make a scene in this restaurant, and then I remembered that I’m dead and nobody can see me. Old habits die hard, I guess. Unless of course there is a kid who could [see dead people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense), I don’t think anybody in the restaurant would have notice me cry.

As I was almost going to burst into tears, when a waitress slams a menu on my table, said she will come back to take my orders shortly and walks away.

I am not dead, this is just one of those restaurant with bad service and rude waiters.

I’ve never felt so relieved in my entire life. The joy I have in me knowing that I am still alive is wonderful. Everything starts to brighten up.

I can continue living my life again. Back to my boring and mundane life. That was my first near-death experience, I feel like I’ve learned something. If only I know what it is.
