A brand new start. I feel that I need a personal outlet, a web space I can call my own. [Jiboneus.com](http://jiboneus.com) started out as that, a personal blog, however now it has become a beast of it’s own. I have other plans for Jiboneus.com, and this website is for everything else.

I wanted to try this writing thing more, I don’t really like my writings, because I find it to be over-written and under-editted. We’ll see how it goes.

Anyway I just need an excuse to try out this theme I’ve created. It has a name you know, and no I’m not sharing that piece of information to you.
