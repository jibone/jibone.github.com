A philosophy professor asked his student just one question for their final exam. The question was :-

> How are you going to make me believe that this chair in front of you is invisible?

It took all the student one hour to finish writing their answer, except for one lazy student who only took five seconds. The next day, the results are posted. The lazy student got the highest score. His answer was :-

> What chair?

You have to first convince yourself before convincing others. Sometimes the less complicated things are the more convincing it become.

If I were to major in philosophy, I would have aced the course.
