Let just say that you live in a house, and this hypothetical house is sound proof. You can’t hear anything coming from the outside. It’s raining outside but you don’t know that it is. Because you can’t hear the hypothetical rain in your hypothetical sound proof house, until of course when you step outside. Everything was find as you go on you hypothetical live in your hypothetical house while it’s hypothetically raining cats and dogs outside.

One day you notice that your carpet is wet. The roof is leaking and little drops of the rain is dripping on your carpet. This is the first time you find out that it’s raining outside. So do you blame the rain? no. Do you fix the leaking roof? no. You blame the carpet instead. Stupid carpet gets wet and soggy making things uncomfortable for you. Lets find the creator of the carpet, get him and blame him for everything.

Lets shout down the carpet. Take away all the DNS pointing to it. Put a warrant for the carpet’s creator, most probably he is a child molester too.

As you can see, I am no expert on the subject matter. What I do know is that Wikileaks is an international non-profit media publishing outlet where by an anonymous individual could submit (leaks) certain documents that the normal public might not have access too.

I understand that secrets is needed in any organization either in government, military or the banking sector. But it is not the media’s responsibility to keep such secrets save. It’s the responsibility of those organization to keep their secrets, a secret.

Wikileaks, as different and game changing as it maybe, it’s best to my knowledge still a media outlet, and to shut it down is in a way putting censorship to press, and that the idea of shutting it down coming from the U.S. government itself is suppressing. The same U.S. government that condemns the actions of governments such as those People’s Republic Of China with their notorious policy of controlling the press and general media.

The [tweet by Congressman Ron Paul](https://twitter.com/repronpaul/status/10716266021003264) pretty much sums it up.
