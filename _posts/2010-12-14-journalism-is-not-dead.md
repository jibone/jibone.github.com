Internet technology had brought down the entry level. Everybody who knows how to register and setup a blogger website can call himself/herself a ‘independent journalist’, sort of, based on a loosely definition of journalist. So does that makes your degree in journalism obsolete? I don’t think so.

The newspaper model is dying. Who wants to read yesterday’s news when you can have the news live as and when it’s happening. More and more, nasi lemak sellers are now starting to use the brown paper instead of newspaper to wrap their nasi lemak. So yes newspapers are dying. It’s the news delivery model that are dying but not the news agencies.

Darwinism, you either evolve or become extinct. As rigid journalists from old time news agencies tries to adapt to the new online world they discovered that it’s full of other so called ‘independent journalist’ and they call themselves under the moniker, ‘Blogger’. So what happens now?

To me content is always king, and that good quality content will rise above the rest. I believe that. Either you are an old school journalist or a new school blogger, in the end of the day it’s your content that matter the most.

So don’t throw away your journalism degree, adapt and make good use of it for this new online world. CNN has iReport, a user-generated section of CNN.com where users could submit their news piece. CNN made it clear that this section are not edited, fact-checked or screened by CNN before they are posted. Only those marked with ‘CNN iReport’ have been vetted.

Instead of news agencies fighting with bloggers, why not work together and both can live of each other. Yes this is a long rambling from a computer science graduate, on journalism. Go figure.
