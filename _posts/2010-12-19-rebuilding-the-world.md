> A father was trying to read the newspaper, but his little son kept pestering him. Finally, the father grew tired of this and, tearing a page from the newspaper – one that bore a map of the world – he cut it into several pieces and handed them to his son.

> “Right, now you’ve got something to do. I’ve given you a map of the world and I want to see if you can put it back together correctly.”

> He resumed his reading, knowing that the task would keep the child occupied for the rest of the day. However, a quarter of an hour later, the boy returned with the map.

> “has your mother been teaching you geography?” asked the father in astonishment.

> “I don’t even know what that is,” replied the boy. “But there was a photo of a man on the other side of the page, so I put the man back together and found I’d put the world back together too”
