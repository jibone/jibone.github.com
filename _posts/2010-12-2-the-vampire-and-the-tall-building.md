> There were some buildings. They were these really tall buildings, and they could walk.  
> 
> There were these vampires and one of the vampires bit the tallest building and his fangs broke off. Then all his other teeth fell out.    
> 
> Then he started crying.
> 
> And then all the other vampires said, "Why are you crying? Aren’t they just your baby teeth?"
> 
> And, he said, "no, those were my grown up teeth."
> 
> And the other vampires knew that he couldn’t be a vampire anymore so they left him. 
> 
> The end.
