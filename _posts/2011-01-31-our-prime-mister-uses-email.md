The Malaysian Prime Minister sends the Malaysian people, well a portion of the Malaysian people a Chinese New Year greetings via email, and all of the sudden folks are all up in arms on the fact that the Prime Minister spams their inbox.

“How did the Prime Minister get my email? This is spam! I will not put up with it. This is a Privacy Violation!”

Apparently we can put up with emails of people selling viagra, penis enlargement program, Nigerian prince needing some help in transferring some amount of money but not an email from the Prime Minister Office?

So they might had gotten the email addresses though some unsolicited method. [This blog post](http://amanz.my/2011/01/emel-najibcny-telah-dikumpulkan-dari-pelbagai-pangkalan-data/) is saying that it comes through Media Prima database and others a like. Here is [another blog post](http://me.zestful.org/my-two-cents-on-the-najibcny-issue-and-how-they-got-your-emai) that discusses more on that.

So what?

In this day, your email address is not longer sacred. No matter how good you are at hiding your email address, you will get unsolicited emails send to you. Do you expect to only receive emails from those you know? That is why they invented the ‘spam box’.

I read lots of blogs, I do admire the writers, but most of them doesn’t even know I exist. So if I though of wishing them a happy Chinese New Year with some stories of my childhood, and starts digging for their email, that makes me a ‘spammer’?

Well that’s no fun.
