> The reason the king is so powerful is because he’s made a pact with the Devil,’ a very devout woman in the streets told the boy, and he was intrigued.

> Some time later, when he was traveling to another town, the boy heard a man beside him remark: ‘All this land belongs to the same man. I’d say the Devil had a hand in that.’

> Late one summer afternoon, a beautiful woman walked past the boy.

> ‘That woman is in the service of Satan!’ cried a preacher angrily.

> From then on, the boy decided to seek the Devil out, and when he found him, he said: ‘They say you can make people powerful, rich and beautiful.’

> ‘Not really,’ replied the Devil. ‘You’ve just been listening to the views of those who are trying to promote me.’
