Every Malaysian citizen has the democratic right under the Malaysian Federal Constitution to hold peaceful demonstration. That is what they say. Every Malaysian citizen also has the rights to freedom of movement. No one can stop a law abiding citizen to go from one place to another.

So the question here is that when a peaceful protest done on the streets, blocking and limiting other citizenâ€™s rights of movement, getting from one place to another, does that still considered a peaceful protest?

Do I, as a Malaysian citizen and 20 or so of my friends who are also Malaysian citizens has the right to sit in the middle of the most busiest roads in Kuala Lumpur, causing massive traffic congestion all over town?

My peaceful protest with 20 or so of my buddies affects 2000 or so city dwellers. A delivery truck was late to reach its destination and a business was affected. A soon to be dad could no reach the hospital in time to be with his wife as she give birth to their new born.

To me a peaceful protests or a peaceful demonstrations are the ones that does not effect others directly. Than again the impact is lessen and not everyone will be aware of the issue. Which is why protest need to be creative, it must be thought provoking enough to make people aware of the issue but at the same time does not get in the way of other citizens who might not agree with your cause.

How do one do that? Figure it out.
