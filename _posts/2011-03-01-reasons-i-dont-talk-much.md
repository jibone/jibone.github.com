I don’t really talk much. Mainly because I am a quite person. Just ask anybody close to me, he or she will either say, “yeah he don’t talk much.” or “yeah he is a quite person”. Here are a few reason why I don’t talk much.

**I have nothing to say** – Most of the time I really have nothing to say. While other people will work hard to find something to say, for example talking about weather or politics, but not me. I have no interest in politics, and I am perfectly fine with Google or the weather app on my phone to tell me about the weather.

**I really don’t care about what you have to say** – If I do really care about what you have to say, I would asked and strike a conversation with you. If you find me striking a conversation with you, that most probably is because I genuinely care of what you have to say.

**I don’t know how to say what I am thinking** – I find it better and easier for me to write down my thoughts than to speak it. Weird. I know.

**My voice sounds weird** – I have a short tongue and a nerdy voice. It is not the most sexy voice you’ll ever here that is for sure. I have trouble saying ‘s’ and ‘r’.

**I’m socially awkward** – All the other previous points just proves how awkward I am socially.

So that is some of the reason of why I don’t talk much. One thing is for sure is that I do not hate you. It takes a lot for me to hate someone.
