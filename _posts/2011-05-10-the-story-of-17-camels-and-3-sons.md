> A man left to his three sons 17 camels. On his will he requested that the first son gets half (1/2) of the camels, the second son gets one-third (1/3rd) of the camels and the third son get one-ninth (1/9th) of the camels.

> All three sons gets into a heated argument as they try to split the camels. 17 can’t be divided by two, by three or by nine. How would they than honor their father’s wish.

> The three sons decides to go meet the village elder, the wisest man in the village. They told him their problem. Wise village elder thought really long to solve this problem.

> “I have no way of solving your problem.” the wise old man said, “However I could lend you one of my camel, which makes your total of camels to 18, which now can be devised into half (1/2), one-third (1/3) and one-ninth (1/9).”

> The brothers were reluctant to take the old man’s camel at first, but proceed home with 18 camels all together. They started to divide the camels as how it was instructed by their father.

> The eldest son gets half of the camels, 1/2 of 18 is 9.

> The second son gets one-third of the camels, 1/3 of 18 is 6.

> The youngest son gets one-ninth of the camels, 1/9 of 18 is 2.

> 9 camels plus 6 camels plus 2 camels is 17. They now have one extra camels. Not sure what to do with it they went back to visit the village elder and gives him the last camel.

Someone once told me this old Arab fable, I recently was reminded of this fable while watching one of the TED Talks presented by William Ury. Sometime when there is an insolvable conflict, all that is needed is someone lending an extra camel.
