Wirawan Web is my latest project with [Zaidel Baharuddin](https://twitter.com/sinatra_z). We started this webzine/weblogs for web geeks and Internet freaks. We are keeping it web/internet related with topics ranging from silly things like Twitter trending hashtags and viral videos to a more serious stuff like Interent censorships and online privacy.

It is not yet a month since it was first launched with the first post, yet it seems that traffic is doing good. I guess we were lucky, thanks to the MCMC letter that we posted and the whole censorship issue. We thought we would have a month worth of web memes and viral videos before we touch on more serious stuff, guess not.
