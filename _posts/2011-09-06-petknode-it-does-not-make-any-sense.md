These few days, Malaysian cat lovers, Kitteh defenders alike were up in arms over what had happened to over 200 pet felines that were supposed to be under the care of Petknode, a company that offers cat boarding services. These are pet cats and not stray cats.

Over the long Raya holiday, pet owners had send their cats to Petknode while they and their family went to their hometown to celebrate the Raya festive with the rest of the extended family. It’s a long known Raya ‘balik kampung’ tradition.

I am not to familiar with Petknode, but I’ve heard of them before. I’ve heard good things about them before, from those who had send their pet cats to them. So this whole incident came as a shock to some.

Petknode had took in over 200 cats and those cats were left in their cages for over 9 days or so with out any supervision. No food or water for the cats. Even prisoners have their daily meals, it’s as if the cats were left there to,… die.

Most of the animal lovers are still in rage over what had happened. I put the rage and anger aside and try to think of what or why Petknode did what they did. Nobody is pure evil, there is always some sort of reasoning behind it.

I can believe that they just leave the cats for over a week and thought that things would be fine when the owners come to pick their pets later after the holiday was over.

My first thought is that they are running a con job. Take the money and leave. However, to my knowledge Petknode have been operating for quite sometime and there were no complaints before this.

Can you imagine that over 200 cats were send by their owner to Petknode. This cat boarding service is a very lucrative business in a long term. Why would the Petknode owners jeopardize what seems to be a very profitable lucrative long term business for a making just a little quick buck? Are they that short sighted?

If this were a con job, then they the Petknode owners are the stupidest con men ever. They should already disappear, out of the country type of disappear, they should have already run away with the few bucks they had made over the Raya promotion. Yet they are still here, the police are able to get them at their house?

That does not make sense.

My second thought is that they had took in more cats than they can handle. This is obviously so. Maybe they had hire some illegal foreign workers to take care of the basic necessities of the cats while they were gone for the Raya holiday. The illegal foreign workers then had run away for some reason leaving the cats just like that.

But, if that was the case, didn’t they as the employers ever called and check? Can’t they come back if something were wrong?

That does not make sense either.

Third thought came to mind. Maybe they, the Petknode owner were running from someone? Maybe they had loaned some money from loan sharks and were unable to pay them back. They thought that by doing a Raya promotion and taking in 200 cats would be enough to save their ass, but it is not enough. It always isn’t enough when dealing with loan sharks. Fear of what the loan sharks would do to them they run and leave the cats under their care behind.

I know that people do make unreasonable decisions when pressured by loan sharks. Fear of their life, or fear of the public humiliation they might face with the loan sharks. It’s better to get sued by pet owners then to face the loan sharks? Who knows…

We will never know what or why and I am not saying that I know either. I am not trying to justified their action either. This is just me trying to make some sense over what had happen with the Petknode fiasco.
