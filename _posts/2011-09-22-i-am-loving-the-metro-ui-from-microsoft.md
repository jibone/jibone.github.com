Those who knows me personally probably know that I am an Apple/Mac centric kind of person. No, I’m not going to use the ‘F’ word that rhythms with ‘boy’ but I have been called that from time to time.

Secretly I have a crush on the Metro UI design that Microsoft is adopting on all of it’s new OS devices. Even though on the Wikipedia page it says that the Metro principles were use as early as Microsoft Encrata 95, but I think it was the Zune that Metro makes its first appearance. And now you can see the user interface on Windows Phone 7.

The thought process behind Metro is as if the Microsoft designer folks are saying, “Look at what Apple is doing, we do the opposite.”

Apple has rounded corners in their icons and stuff, Microsoft’s Metro have sharp edges. Apple’s iOS is about icons of apps, Microsoft’s Metro is about tiles.

Metro to me is more then just a theme you slap on an OS or software. It’s a design philosophy.

> “Metro is our design language. We call it metro because it is modern and clean. It is fast and in motion. It’s about content and typography. And it’s entirely authentic.”

Some people says that they are annoyed with the whole lack of UI in Metro, but it is in fact the lack of ‘UI’ that I love. There are few core principles that defines the Microsoft Metro Language, and I’ll try to go through here pretending that I know a thing or two about design.
