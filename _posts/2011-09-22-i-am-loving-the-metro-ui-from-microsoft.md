Those who knows me personally probably know that I am an Apple/Mac centric kind of person. No, I’m not a 'fanboy' but I have been called that from time to time.

Secretly however, I have a crush on the Metro UI design that Microsoft is adopting for their OS on new devices. Even though on the Wikipedia page it says that the Metro principles were use as early as Microsoft Encrata 95, but I think it was the Zune that Metro really makes its first appearance and people start noticing it. And now you can see the user interface on Windows Phone 7.

I wonder how the thought process for this new Metro UI came to be. It is as if Microsoft designer folks looked at Apple and decides to go the very opposite.

Apple has rounded corners in their icons, buttons, UI containers and other UI elements. Microsoft’s Metro have sharp edges on most of their UI elements. Apple’s iOS is about icons of apps, Microsoft’s Metro decides not to use icons instead live tiles that apps can push informations to.

Metro to me is more then just a theme you slap on an OS or software. It’s a design philosophy.

> “Metro is our design language. We call it metro because it is modern and clean. It is fast and in motion. It’s about content and typography. And it’s entirely authentic.”

Most people are annoyed with the whole lack of UI in Metro, but it is in fact for that reason of less UI chrome that I love Metro. There are few core principles that defines the Microsoft Metro Language, and I’ll try to go through some of it here pretending that I know a thing or two about design.

###Typography

Typography plays an important role in the whole Metro design language. The slim Segoe based font family fits right in with the sharp edges of the design element. It is not just about beautiful fonts for text labels, it is functional. 

With the right balance of weight, white space and positioning it creates a visual hierarchy without the need for extra UI elements. In Metro it's clear that which text is the title and which are the content.

###Motion

Transition are and important element to a UI design. It tells the story and user knows what to expect. Metro has a consistent set of animations that are not just pretty to look at but serve a functional purpose. 

###Content not Chrome

This is my favorite. I always think that content itself can be the interface. All other UI containers and elements just get in the way. Content has to always be the top priority.

Metro really implement this to its core. No chrome no distraction. 

###Honesty

Metro design language is design for the digital. Metro knows that it is designed for the digital device and Metro does not pretend to be something else. 

A note taking application does not need to look like a Moleskine note book. A calendar application does not need to look like a leather bound desk calendar. Metro does not pretend to be something it is not. 

##Moving forward

I hope Microsoft will move forward with this new paradigm shift of digital interface. This is the most innovative thing coming from Microsoft. 

Nobody ever gets it right the first time, Metro has it shares of haters. I hope Microsoft will still keep pushing this, and keep on going in this path.
