A silly little website that searches Foursquare checkins at a certain area on the map. It finds trending venues and display it on the map. You might have guessed it already, Iâ€™m just playing around with the Foursquare API. Try it out:- [lab.jshamsul.com/crowded](http://lab.jshamsul.com/crowded)

If there is not trending venue, use the form to jump to a certain location. List of trending venues are displayed once you are at a location where there are a lot of checkins.

Some technology and API used for this project are, Foursquare API, Google Map API v3, Google Map Utility Library MarkerClusterer. Codes are up on Github, if you want to have a look.

Does this thing have legs? probably not.
