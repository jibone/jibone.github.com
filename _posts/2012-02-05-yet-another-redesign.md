I’ve lost count how many times I did a redesign to this website of mine. One thing for sure is that the more redesign I do, the less of a ‘design’ it has become. Here you see me obsessed in minimalistic white-space heavy design. Less is not just more, less is better. Sort of.

I’ve also decided to adopt [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), not entirely just most of the basic ideas and snippets from that project. I even keep the bright pink highlighting color, go ahead highlight my text. Since I love doing my CSS with Sass now, I use this little project on Github, [HTML5-Boilerplate-with-Sass](https://github.com/grega/HTML5-Boilerplate-with-Sass).

I spend a large amount of time arguing with myself while doing this theme. Should I use a light border to separate items, or just a big fat white-space. You can see which route I took.

Here are some snapshots of how this website looks previously:-

I’ve also decided to share the code. The theme code are on a [public Github repo](https://github.com/jibone/wp-jshamsul.com).
