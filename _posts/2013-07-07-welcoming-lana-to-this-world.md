Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life, Not only that I am a son and a husband, I am now a dad. Last year about the same time, I married my lovely wife, Nurul Izwa. This year we are blessed with our daughter Lana.

####How do you feel now?

I got asked that a lot. It feels different that's for sure. My priority in life has changed.

Deep down I feel that my time is running out. When we were young we felt invincible. We felt that the world is ours for the taking. We do stuff, risky stuff and stupid stuff without considering any of there consequences.

Now with a daughter to take care of, I no longer felt that way. The world is not mine for the taking any more, it's hers. It's her world now, we are just living in it. 

My time is up, soon it's going to be her time. All we as parents can do is to hand down to her as much wisdom as we can. Wisdom that we have collected all these years. 

That, together with the wisdom she that she finds for herself, she is going to conquer the world, take on any challenges life may bring to her. 

And we will right there supporting her.

Just felt like I should write something about my daughter Lana. Still getting use to saying that two words, 'my daughter'.
