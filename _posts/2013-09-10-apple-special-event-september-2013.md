I used to write for an Apple/Mac centric blog, and each time there were any Apple Special Event, we would stayed up late at night looking at liveblogs and IRC channels. After that I would write a short post on what I thought of the announcement. 

Just for nostalgia sake I am doing one here.

The reality distortion field level in this one is very low. It might be because this is one of those rare times where all almost all the rumor websites actually got it right. What rumored to happen, happened. No surprises here.

Apple introduces the iPhone5c priced lower then the premium iPhones, which people are jokingly calling it 'iPhone 5 cheap'. The 'c' here of course stands for 'colors'.

These Lumia looking iPhones are unapologetically plastic. Even though it is plastic, from the videos and photos it looks very solidly builded. So does the Lumia phones.

Apple iPhones has always been a premium product. Other smart phone manufactures are killing it in the lower end market and it seems Apple wants a piece of the action. The lower priced iPhone might just do it. Might make the iPhone look 'hip' to the younger consumers. It's priced towards them too. 

However I think the real reason for Apple to introduce a new line of lower end iPhone is to make the next generation of Apple's current line of iPhone looks more premium. They even colored it gold.

It's always been the case where an 's' version of the iPhone is just a spec upgrade, and it looks exactly like the non-'s' version. How would people know you have the latest and greatest iPhone when what you have looks the same as the previous version? Apple address this by making a gold colored iPhone of course.

This iPhone5s is just a test run for the fingerprint scanner. If the technology works flawlessly, I bet we will be seeing this on all of Apple devices. 

However it seems Apple trust the scanner enough that you can have it as a verification for an iTunes Store purchase. 

It was a short announcement and there was no 'one more thing.' I think that have always been a Steve Jobs thing.
