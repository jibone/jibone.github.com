I notice this while surfing on Apple's website. I was on the [iPhone5c page](http://www.apple.com/iphone-5c/) looking at more pictures and reading specs. Just browsing around.

Apple had introduced this funky looking iPhone5c cases where you can mismatch colors. Seems like fun. I then notice the word 'hon' on one of those holes in the cases.

I keep thinking what is that word, until I eventually figured it out that it was the word 'iPhone' with the letters 'iP' and 'e' blocked by the case and only 'hon' is visible through one of the holes. 

I know this is such a small minor design issue and only effects the aesthetic just slightly, but if Steve Jobs is still around, I don't think that he would have approved this case design.
