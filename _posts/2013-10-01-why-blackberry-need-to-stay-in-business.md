There have been a lot of talks on the interwebs lately that RIM the makers of BlackBerry is going under. The company just can't keep up with the rest of the smartphone manufactures. 

This saddens me. I never was a BlackBerry person. I never used any BlackBerry devices. However I think that it is important that BlackBerry stays and still makes devices with their own software and OSes.

I used to use a 3rd generation iPhone, but not anymore. My current phone is a Nokia 105 basic feature phone. It can receive and make calls and SMS and that is about all that it can do. No camera, no bluetooth, no 3G, no GPS, no touch screen. I'm quite satisfied with that.

Now if I would ever consider a smart phone, I would choose a BlackBerry and here is a reason why I think it is important for BlackBerry to stay in business.

At the moment we only hear about these three mobile platform competing against each other, Apple's iOS, Google's Android and Microsoft Windows Phone. The whole world's smart phone market runs either this 3 platform now.
 
All three companies were mentioned in [Snowden's leaked NSA slides](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data), Google, Apple and Microsoft. All three platform are developed by companies based in the United States, subjected to the U.S. draconian laws, where they have to comply with National Security Letters. It is highly possible that all three major platform have backdoors which lets intelligent agencies like NSA access it.

BlackBerry the company formerly known as RIM (Research In Motion) is a Canadian based telecommunication and wireless equipment company. They are the only non-U.S. smart phone manufacture that still have their own operating system and their own platform. 

I can't guarantee that BlackBerry does not have backdoors, but it's my best bet at the moment.

Nokia used to have Symbian, but now runs Windows Phone OSes and are in the process of being bought over by Microsoft.

Other options are to use a open-source mobile operating system like the ones currently being developed by Mozilla, [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) (boot2gecko) or the [Ubuntu Phone](http://www.ubuntu.com/phone). These platform however are still in its infancy and still needs some work to be done.
