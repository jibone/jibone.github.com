With the recent events regarding presentations slides and other classified documents about the NSA digitally spying on Internet users leaked, cryptography has become a hot topic. The technique of securing communication in the presence of a third party, in this case the NSA, are being discusses among tech geeks.

We all now know that the NSA collects and kept all form of digital communications. One way of hiding it from them is to use an encryption. However sending an encrypted email is like raising a big sign saying "look at me, I'm doing something in secret, therefor I must be doing something illegal!" The NSA has more reason to keep an email when it's encrypted than an unencrypted email. Once they have an encrypted email it is just the better of how much time and resources they want to spend in breaking it.

This is where Hipster Crypto come in handy. Hipster Crypto will disguise your message with words typically used by hipsters. This way whoever that's intercepting your message would think that it's just a two hipsters emailing each other.

Now before all you start emailing me saying that this in not real crypto, I created this as a joke. I got the idea from [Hipster Ipsum](http://hipsteripsum.me/) where instead of using your typical 'lorem ipsum' as placeholder text, it generated paragraphs containing words typically used by hipsters. 

Hipster Crypto is just a simple basic symmetric key encryption. Both party have to agree upon a secret 'passphrase' and use that for both encrypting and decrypting the message.

I put up the code on a [Github repo](https://github.com/jibone/Hipster-Crypto) just for fun.
