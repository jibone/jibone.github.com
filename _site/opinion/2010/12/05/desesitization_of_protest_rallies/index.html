          <h1 id='desesitization_of_protest_rallies'>Desesitization of protest rallies</h1>

<p>Today there was yet another protest rally in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. It was as per usual. Gather at Masjid Negara (National Mosque) then head over to Istana Negara (National Palace) to hand out a memorandum to the Agung (King). This post however is not about that particular protest, it’s about street protest in general all around the world.</p>

<p>Protest and street rallies used to meant something back in the days. It’s used to be the last resort after every other means fails. Marches, Blockades and sit-ins, are the last form of expressing disapproval (or approval) on issues in a nonviolence manner. Since it’s the last leg of nonviolence confrontation to a certain issue it could easily turn violence, which then transform the protest into a riot.</p>

<p>Protest rallies and street demonstrations used to meant something. But these days, most people have already been desensitize to the act. Everybody is going to forget with today’s street rally and move on to other things by tomorrow morning. It used to be that street rallies are remembered for months and years.</p>

<p>I blamed both the media and those who utilized this form of protest as a tactical move to move forward their agenda for the desensitization of street rallies.</p>

<p>Its long since it has become a tradition for the media to watered down the reports on street rallies giving the views the idea that it’s nothing more then just a bunch of misguided folks creating mischief. Nothing to see here, and now back to the real news, some celebrity’s marriage is on the rocks.</p>

<p>Another factor that contributes to the desensitization of street rallies is the fact that it is used countless of time as the first means of raising an issue. Street demonstration first, talks and discussion later.</p>

<p>Street demonstration and street protest is a powerful tool to bring important issues to the front, but when used too often it looses its impact. And when the time comes when there is really important issue that needs the attention, it will just be yet another rally by so and so, nothing to see here.</p>

<p>This is happening to all around the world, not just here in Malaysia. The impact of nonviolence street protests becomes lesser and lesser at every protest.</p>
