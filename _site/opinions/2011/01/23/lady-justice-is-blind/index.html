          <p>We have seen it many times in cop movies. There is a scene where the hero cop has to give up his badges due to whatever reason it is, yet somehow badge-less, he still pursue the case.</p>

<p>Rules and laws supposedly were designed to stop people from doing bad things, and yet why is it that in order for the hero cop to do the right thing, he has to give up his badge - the symbol that shows he is the man of the law.</p>

<p>If it is because sometime, in order to do what is right, we have to break the law, then that is surely a sign of flawed in the law itself, no?</p>

<p>Maybe there is a separation of what is right and what is lawfully right. Those are two different thing. So which is mote important? to uphold the law? or to do what is right?</p>

<p>If you have ever seen the statue of Lady Justice, the Roman goddess of Justice, you’ll notice that she is holding a scale in one hand, a sword on the other and she is blindfolded. Ultimate justice is morally blind.</p>

<p>A poor man steals a loft of bread in order to feed his starving children. That is the only short term solution he has. The bread maker knows the poor man’s situation pretty well, and yet went after the man, captured him and prosecute him in court.</p>

<p>In the lawful eye, he is guilty of stealing. Lady Justice is blind, she only sees either if the person is guilty of the crime, or not. Lady Justice can’t see anything beyond that. All she has to do actually is to explore why such crime was committed.</p>

<p>In the rightful eye, we would have found the bread maker guilty. He already know what the situation is for the man who steals a loft oh his bread. He knows pretty well that his children has nothing to eat for days and are starving. Yet he still when after the man for stealing his bread.</p>

<p>Our laws aren’t designed for compassion. Our laws are binary logic, one or zero, black or white, true or false, right or wrong. Maybe laws should be robust and approximate rather than brittle and exact. That on the other hand would leave room for law breakers to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, our laws are actually somewhat fuzzy is some sense. In the case of the bread thief, since it’s his first offense, and under the circumstances, most probably he got it easy. He is still guilty thought.</p>
