        <p>My name is <strong>J. Shamsul Bahri</strong>. I am a full stack
        <strong>Web Developer</strong> based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I enjoy
        making website for both fun and profit. I build hand-crafted, 
        mobile-responsive websites with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and 
        other delicious web technologies.</p>
        <p>I founded and co-founded two online web publications, better 
        known as ‘webzines’ – <a href="http://jiboneus.com">jiboneus.com</a> 
        and <a href="http://wirawanweb.com">wirawanweb.com</a>. I am still 
        heavily involved in both of them.</p>
        <p>I have been called both an ‘Apple Fanboy’ and a ‘Linux Geek’. 
        I have no idea how that came to be. Recently I had openly 
        confessed my love for the new Microsoft Windows Metro/Modern Interface. 
        This only adds more to the confusion.</p>
