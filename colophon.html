        <p>This is the colophon page. A recognition to the tools and software 
        that were used in creation of this website.</p>
        <p>Before we go any further, I would like to get one thing straight: 
        this is a personal site and the thoughts and opinions expressed here 
        are entirely my own. This site is in no way connected with my 
        employment, past or present, and absolutely nothing I've written should 
        be taken as expressing or implying anything on my employer's behalf.</p>
        <p>There are two custom fonts used in this website, they are - "Open Sans"
        and "Poly". Both of them are avaliable in Google Web Font.</p>
        <p>This website uses <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to generate 
        all it's pages. And it's hosted on Github for convenience. You can check 
        out the source code on <a href="https://github.com/jibone/jibone.github.com">Github</a>.</p>
        <p>I always have a <em>Terminal</em> window open when I am working. 
        <em>MacVim</em> is my text editor of choice. <em>Git</em> is my prefered 
        version control. <em>Chrome</em> is currently my preferred browser, 
        however I change browser all the time. Occasionally I open up 
        <em>Adobe Photoshop</em> to do some graphical related stuff, but I try
        to avoid doing so as much as posible.</p>
        <p>If jshamsul.com looks goofy in your browser, most probably because you 
        are using a shitty web browser. My guess would be an older version of 
        Internet Explorer. Complaint all you want, I donâ€™t care less. Get yourself 
        modern standards-compliant browser.</p>
        <p>However, if you do think that you are using a modern, standards-compliant 
        browser and are having trouble viewing this website, please do let me know.</p>
